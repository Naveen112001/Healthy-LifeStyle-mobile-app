<li>Foods to eat Let's see what foods people with hypothyroidism should eat.</li> 
<li>People with hypothyroidism should first take a nutritious diet.</li>
<li>You can eat green leafy vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and zinc-rich legumes, chickpeas and beans. </li>
<li>If you have symptoms of hypothyroidism, take foods rich in selenium and iodine.</li>
<li>Because zinc helps to regulate the thyroid. It sends a signal to the brain to release thyroid hormone.</li>
<li>Selenium is another essential mineral that helps in the proper functioning of the thyroid gland. It acts as an oxidant. </li>
<li>Protects the thyroid gland from damage caused by free radicals.</li>
<li>Brazil, nuts, tuna, herring, eggs and legumes are excellent sources of selenium.</li>
<li>Iodine is a mineral needed to make thyroid hormones.</li>
<li>People with iodine deficiency are more likely to have hypothyroidism in the morning. </li>
<li>So adding iodine rich foods like sponge, fish, milk and eggs can help to overcome this deficiency.</li>
<li>He also said that fruits and vegetables rich in phytosterols are also good for the immune system. </li>
<li>He also said that blueberries, olive oil, nuts, green tea, cloves and apples are good for thyroid health.</li>
<li>Foods to Avoid People with hypothyroidism should avoid coitrogens in particular, according to the doctor.</li>
<li>This is because coitrogens interfere with the normal functioning of the thyroid gland.</li>
<li>Soy products, vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower contain coagulants.</li>
<li>Fruits like peaches and plums also contain coagulants.</li>
<li>Highly processed and fried foods contain unsaturated fats, according to the doctor. </li>
<li>This can make the symptoms of hypothyroidism worse.</li>
<li>Do not take fiber foods immediately after taking thyroid medication.</li>
<li>This is because fibrous foods can interfere with medications.</li>
<li>Take fiber foods 2-3 hours after taking the medication.

</li>
