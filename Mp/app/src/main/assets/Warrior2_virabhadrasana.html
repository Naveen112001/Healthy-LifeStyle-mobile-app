<h2>Warrior 2 – Virabhadrasana II</h2><img src="Warrior-2-pose.png" alt="Flowers in Chania" width="360" height="345">
<h3> 
The Warrior II yoga pose also strengthens your legs and arms, opens your chest and shoulders, and it contracts your abdominal organs. Your breath needs to be regulated, your focus should be on the expansion of your arms which will help you to improve your patience. Keep your self elevated rather than collapsing with your hips – don’t allow gravitation to pull you down. Stay strong.
