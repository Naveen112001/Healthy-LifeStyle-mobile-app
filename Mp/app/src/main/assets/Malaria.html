            <ul>
<li>Malaria is a disease caused by the bite of a mosquito called Anopheles.</li>
<li>The disease causes fever and muscle cramps.</li>
<li>Although there are no separate diets for this disease, it is possible to recover quickly from this attack by eating enough nutritious foods</li>
<li>Eat or drink fruits that are high in water.</li>
<li>In particular, the body can get the water it needs by drinking highly hydrated beverages such as lemongrass and lentils.</li>
<li>Watermelon, also known as water fruit, can be eaten with high hydration fruits such as cucumber and orange.</li>
<li>This is because dehydration is one of the major problems facing our body when it comes to malaria.</li>
<li>In this condition, we can maintain water balance by eating fluids, fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>Vegetables and fruits that are high in Vitamin A and C should be taken in moderation during this period.</li>
<li>When malaria strikes, the muscles become much weaker.</li>
<li>During that time, the body's protein requirements will be greatly reduced.</li>
<li>It is essential to follow a high protein diet to correct it.</li>
<li>Foods high in protein such as milk, yogurt and cheese are high in protein. </li>
<li>All products made with milk as the main ingredient contain a lot of protein. Foods like spinach, legumes, green peas, butter beans, mushrooms and whole grains are high in protein. </li>
<li>People with malaria can gain immunity very quickly by eating this type of food and get rid of malaria.</li>
<li>Foods high in fat should be avoided only when possible.</li>
<li>Just as nutrients such as protein and vitamins are important, so too are fats essential for the human body.</li>
