<li>Spread a thin white cloth on the floor, remove the heavy willow stalks and place it on the bed. </li> 
<li>If you have children, wrap only a thin cloth around the body.</li>
<li>The elderly should also be wrapped in thin cloth without underwear.</li>
<li>Irritation can be caused by the deposition of mistletoe on the blisters when lying on the wicker.</li>
<li>The milk dripping from the blisters deposits on the mistletoe so that they do not spread.</li>
<li>Householders will tell you not to bathe those who come with measles.</li>
<li>So daily add turmeric with mistletoe, cool the boiled water and mix it lightly with water and wipe the body.</li>
<li>If possible do this twice. Doing so will reduce the heat of the blisters and cool the body. Change the mistletoe on the bed every day.</li>
<li>The mistletoe should be discarded without dust. The bed should be changed daily. The mistletoe should be dusted off.</li>
<li>Similarly, even if it is a thin cloth, squeeze it well, put it in hot water, squeeze it, dry it and then wear it. People with measles should wash their clothes separately. </li>
<li>Spicy, salty foods and oily foods should not even catch the eye as measles can be caused by body heat.</li>
<li>Liquid foods, fruit juices, and cold foods such as juveniles can cure measles quickly.</li>
<li>Mountain bananas, green bananas and marzipans are ideal.</li>
<li>Drink two juices daily. If the blisters are very large, you can apply water to cool it.</li>
<li>Lemon juice, whey, water, pulp, salty drinks and cold foods in fruit juices can help control measles quickly.</li>
<li>Boil two leaves of mistletoe and give it to drink inside.</li>
<li>Take a bath when blisters come and go due to smallpox all over the body.</li>
<li>Then put a handful of mistletoe in a bucket of water before bathing. More camomile.</li>
<li>Grind turmeric and rub it on the scalp and body, especially where there are blisters, so that the blisters disappear. </li>
<li>The scars from the blisters will also disappear.</li>
