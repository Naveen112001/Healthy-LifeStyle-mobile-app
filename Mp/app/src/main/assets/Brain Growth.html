        <li>Seeds should also be given to children. Sunflower, pumpkin seeds should give all. It is even better to treat the baby with nut powder from the age of six months.</li>
        <li>A mixture of whole grains We were given whole grains as nutritious porridge and how to give it after six months with preparation methods. We make mawaki porridge by adding wheat, maize, cardamom, rye, etc., as it is difficult to feed them separately
            or as they are fed. This will give the baby the full amount of energy he needs.</li>
        <li> Many people stop giving this porridge when they start giving solid food to the baby. But it is necessary to give the child a tumbler daily until at least 4 years old. Cereals are high in vitamin B, which is essential for the development of the
            nervous system.</li>
