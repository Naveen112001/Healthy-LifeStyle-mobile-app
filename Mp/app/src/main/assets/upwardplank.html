<h3> 
This is hard nut to crack for a beginner but benefits a lot in weight loss. Wish for rock hard abs, then dive into a upward plank pose. It is one among the best yoga pose for weight loss.
<ul> <li>Sit with your legs stretched and straight.</li>
<li>Keep your hands behind your hips, fingers pointing towards the feet.</li>
<li>Prepare to rise up slowly, with your feet straight and pointed</li>
 <li>Try pulling your head back while raising.</li></ul>

This might feel a bit hard at first, it is the exact opposite of our push up position. But practice do make a man perfect and fit.
