        <h1>MAINTAIN NORMAL FROM BLOOD PRESSURE TIPS</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
<ul >
    <li >
    Lose extra pounds and watch your waistline.<p>Blood pressure often increases as weight increases. Being overweight also can cause disrupted breathing while you sleep (sleep apnea), which further raises your blood pressure.


    Weight loss is one of the most effective lifestyle changes for controlling blood pressure.</p></li>

    <li>Exercise  regularly. <p>Regular physical activity — such as 150 minutes a week, or about 30 minutes most days of the week — can lower your blood pressure by about 5 to 8 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure. It's important to be consistent because if you stop exercising, your blood pressure can rise again</p></li>
    <li>Eat a healthy diet.<p>Eating a diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products and skimps on saturated fat and cholesterol can lower your blood pressure by up to 11 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure. This eating plan is known as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.

    </p> </li>
    <li>Reduce sodium in your diet.<p>Read food labels. If possible, choose low-sodium alternatives of the foods and beverages you normally buy.
        Eat fewer processed foods. Only a small amount of sodium occurs naturally in foods. Most sodium is added during processing.
        Don't add salt. Just 1 level teaspoon of salt has 2,300 mg of sodium. Use herbs or spices to add flavor to your food.
        Ease into it. If you don't feel you can drastically reduce the sodium in your diet suddenly, cut back gradually. Your palate will adjust over time</p></li> 
    <li>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink. <p>Alcohol can be both good and bad for your health. By drinking alcohol only in moderation — generally one drink a day for women, or two a day for men — you can potentially lower your blood pressure by about 4 mm Hg. One drink equals 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.

        But that protective effect is lost if you drink too much alcohol.
        
        Drinking more than moderate amounts of alcohol can actually raise blood pressure by several points. It can also reduce the effectiveness of blood pressure medications.</p></li>
    <li>Quit smoking.<p>Each cigarette you smoke increases your blood pressure for many minutes after you finish. Stopping smoking helps your blood pressure return to normal. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of heart disease and improve your overall health. People who quit smoking may live longer than people who never quit smoking.</p></li>
    <li>back on caffeine.<p>The role caffeine plays in blood pressure is still debated. Caffeine can raise blood pressure up to 10 mm Hg in people who rarely consume it. But people who drink coffee regularly may experience little or no effect on their blood pressure.

        Although the long-term effects of caffeine on blood pressure aren't clear, it's possible blood pressure may slightly increase.
